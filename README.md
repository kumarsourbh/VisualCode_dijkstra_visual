# Visual Interactive Simulation of Dijkstra's Algorithm
### Built using Python + OpenCV | Designed by Sourbh Kumar

This project visually demonstrates how **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** explores a grid, expands nodes, handles obstacles, and reconstructs the shortest path.  
It is designed for Robotics, Drone Navigation, AI Path Planning, and Educational Demonstrations.
